# Pyret

> An implementation of a transpiler, _plus more_, for the
> [Pyret programming language](https://www.pyret.org).
>
> _Experimental, everything is subject to change._

## Goals

**Progress tracked on [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).**

- Personal
  - Began as a project to start learning Rust.
  - Something to procrastinate my school work for.
- Communal
  - Faster compilation and execution, even if compared with cache.
  - Pyret is very difficult to run in a browser outside of
    [code.pyret.org](https://code.pyret.org/).
    - For an educational programming language, it's limited under the
      environment of a single code editor. Expanding allows custom courses to be
      made with a configurable runtime.
    - [`pyret-npm`](https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-npm) is a standalone
      command line, and is unable to allow further internal API configurations.
